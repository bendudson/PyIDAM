Installing
==========

To install this module, first compile the IDAM shared library 
(by D.G.Muir). This will then produce a shared library
"libidam.so". This should be copied into somewhere in your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (e.g. /usr/lib/")

You will need to have installed the NumPy python module
(which provides fast arrays, amongst other things)


Run the install script install.sh:

./install.sh

or alternatively edit setup.py, set 'idamdir' to the directory containing
the idam library source code, and run

python setup.py install

Note: You'll need adminstrator rights for this step, since
it copies the library into Python's site-packages directory.

Using
=====

python

>>> import idam   # Load the library

>>> idam.setHost("mast.fusion.org.uk")         # Change the host name
>>> idam.setHost("mast.fusion.org.uk", 56565)  # Change host name and port
>>> idam.setPort(56565)                        # Change port number

>>> idam.setProperty("verbose")                # Set IDAM library property
>>> idam.setProperty("verbose", False)         # Reset property

>>> d = idam.Data("amc_plasma current", 15100) # Read a data object for MAST shot

>>> d = idam.Data("\\top.inputs:cur", "MDSPLUS::fuslwn.culham.ukaea.org.uk/trmast/159052601")
                                               # Read an MDS+ tree data object

>>> d = idam.Data("\\top.magn:ipla", "MDSPLUS::mdsplus.jet.efda.org/ppf/56000");
                                               # Read a JET MDS+ data object

idam.Data() can also be given host="hostname" and port=portnumber keywords.


The data object returned has the following members:

Data
 |- name   # The name used to request the data (e.g. "amc_plasma current")
 |- source # Source of the data as a string (e.g. "15100")
 |- label  # Short description (e.g. "Plasma Current")
 |- units  # Data units (e.g. "kA")
 |- desc   # longer description (if set)
 |
 |- data   # NumPy array of the data
 |- errl   # Low-side error (may be None)
 |- errh   # High-side error (may be None)
 |
 |- dim    # A list of dimensions, each of which contains:
 |   |
 |   |- label # Short axis label (e.g. "Time (sec)")
 |   |- units # (e.g. "s")
 |   |- data  # Axis values (NumPy array)
 |   |- errl  # Low-side error (may be None)
 |   |- errh  # High-side error (may be None)
 |
 |- order  # Index of time dimension


If no errors are available, then BOTH errl and errh will be None. 
If the error is symmetric, then errl will be equal to errh
